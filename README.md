# dotfiles
This repository holds some of my dotfiles, for easy access across platforms. 

## Usage
When  installing on a new machine, first clone the repository, `cd` into it and then simply run 

```bash
source ~/<path_to_dotfiles>/dotfiles/installation.sh
install-dotfiles ~/<path_to_dotfiles>/dotfiles/
```

As a result, all the dotfiles from the repository will be be given links that live under home (`~/`) and will therefore be automatically picked up by the relevant programs. 

Currently, there are dotfiles for 
- bash (mac OS)
- conda
- vim 
- git
